# Text-Summarization-with-HuggingFace
This repository demonstrates how to use Hugging Face Transformers for text summarization. We focus on two state-of-the-art models:  BART (facebook/bart-large-cnn)  T5 (t5-large)  Both models are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, making them ideal for text summarization.
